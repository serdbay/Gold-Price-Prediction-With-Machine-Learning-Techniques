📁 Financial Market Dataset for EUR/USD Forecasting
This dataset consolidates daily historical financial indicators to support predictive modeling of the EUR/USD currency exchange rate using machine learning techniques.

📌 Project Objective
The primary goal of this project is to apply machine learning algorithms to forecast the EUR/USD exchange rate based on patterns and correlations within key market indicators.

📊 Dataset Overview
Column	Description
Date	Calendar date in MM/DD/YYYY format
SPX	S&P 500 Index closing price (U.S. equity market indicator)
GLD	SPDR Gold Shares ETF price (proxy for gold prices)
USO	United States Oil Fund ETF price (proxy for crude oil prices)
SLV	iShares Silver Trust ETF price (proxy for silver prices)
EUR/USD	Euro to U.S. Dollar exchange rate (target variable)
🧠 Methodology
This project will include the following steps:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Understanding relationships and detecting patterns in the data.

Data Preprocessing – Handling missing values, feature engineering, and normalization.

Model Training – Testing multiple regression-based machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost, LSTM).

Evaluation & Interpretation – Comparing model performance using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and visual analysis.

🛠️ Tools
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Jupyter Notebook or Visual Studio Code

Git for version control

📈 Target Variable
The EUR/USD exchange rate (EUR/USD) is the dependent variable this project aims to predict. All other variables serve as independent features that may influence currency movements.
